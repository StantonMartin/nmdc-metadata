      A material sample. It may be environmental (encompassing many organisms) or isolate or tissue.  
      An environmental sample containing genetic material from multiple individuals is commonly referred to as a biosample.

    description: >-
      An biosample that is a living individual entity such as a bacterium, fungus, plant, animal or a virus.

  ## TODO: provenance on an annotation; some will be directly entered by a submitter;
  ## others will be done post-submission by a curator; others will be done automatically (e.g. by text mining)
  ## or by automatic enrichment methods (e.g. calling ORNL-Identify using geolocation)
