# Metadata management for NMDC

This repo contains code, schema, documentation, and example metadata for the NMDC project

## Schema

The schema is in the [schema](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-metadata/tree/master/schema) folder. The yaml file is the source.

Generated human-readable documentation:

 * https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-metadata/

## Ingest from GOLD

Currently this is in [Jupyter notebooks in a separate repo](https://github.com/microbiomedata/GOLD-ontology-translation/tree/master/notebooks) but this will move to a library here.

## Ingest from EMSL

In progress.

For now see the [metadata files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1frzGlz8EB8inpVokNTSwD6Ia94eVUlsZ) folder on the NMDC drive
